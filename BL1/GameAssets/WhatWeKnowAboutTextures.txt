1). In the exported files:
	a). Normal maps are reasonable
		1). The .obj .mtl files seem to point to the correct normal locations but in 3D viewer this information is lost
		2). We could use the normals to get higher resolution geometry information? Seems pretty simple: https://blenderartists.org/t/normal-map-to-mesh/699687 but honestly doing everything in parametric cad could be easier.
	b). The "color" textures are grey with some of the detail from the in-game view and have single highly colored pixels, could this be encoded information for locating things?
	c). The "light" textures appear to have the in-game details (cracks, hand-drawn details) but are colored strangly, what do the color channels mean??
	d). The "Mask" textures designate which of the 3 colors per manufacturer per material are used where I think
		1). See https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Material_Grade for more details
		2). See manufacturer materials in UModel (preview does not work but export does) for the exact values
	e). The manufacturer materials are captured in seperate U-model files:
		- Need to investigate that format further, color vectors are specified as proportional?
