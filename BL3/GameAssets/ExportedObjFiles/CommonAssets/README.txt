Typically the ambient and diffuse maps for manufacturers will use a placeholder texture rather than the _C texture. This is likely a placeholder for engine-generated coloration observed in game based on manufacturer-specific textures. The placeholders are:

Atlas:   T_Splatter_Blood_D_V5.tga    (Game\LevelArt\Environments\_Global\Decals\Splatter_Blood\Model\Textures\T_Splatter_Blood_D_V5)
COV:     T_PaintedRustyMetal_01_D.tga (Game\Gear\Weapons\_Shared\Textures\Surfaces\T_PaintedRustyMetal_01_D)
Dahl:    None, missing textures in UModel but need to investigate further
Eridian: They only get one gun (Fabricator) whose texture is completely defined, but where are all of the squid barrels?
Jakobs:  T_Wood_Rough_01_D.tga        (Game\Gear\Weapons\_Shared\Textures\Surfaces\T_Wood_Rough_01_D)
